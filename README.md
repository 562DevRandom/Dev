# DEV
This folder contains the initial work in progress for building the "general" fully functional business model. Once the core requirements are met, this local chapter of the office will be officially established, and the core projects will be moved to a PROD repository.

This folder will also serve as the location for members' projects while they are in development. Once a project has officially launched (i.e., once it has a customer), it will be granted its own repository.
